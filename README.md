# About project:

In this project, I used BEM methodology and a component approach to scss style development, placing separate style blocks to make the code easier to read and work with.
Responsive design (for desktop, tablet and mobile) based on mobile first approach.

Semantic layout helps in SEO optimization, search engines, as well as for programs designed for people with disabilities.

In this project, I used variables for styles so that you can easily change them in one place (for example, main color) and there was no need to change this color throughout all project code.

Mixins allow you to reduce the size of the code, as well as make the layout adaptive.

Also, vanilla javascript was used in the project to change the cost of tariff plans.
In this project, I set up stylelint rules that set requirements for code style, which allows to write clean code.
